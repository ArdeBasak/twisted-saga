        <article>
            <p>Well I’m sure you must be wondering how can the sky be red, it might not be but it surely can be. This
                story is about my wife, Megan. I love her dearly. She has always been my support and my best friend.
                Most of my life, I was devoid of love and affection until she came along eight years ago. I have
                hopelessly been in love, ever since. We have been married for 5 years now.</p>
            <p>You know you do love someone when you're ready to do anything for them. I'd do anything for Megan. If she
                said that the call will not let sky was red: it was red. If it wasn't, I'd paint it red. </p>
            <p>We had a beautiful daughter on 8th November, 2 years ago. We named her Catherine after Megan’s
                grandmother.</p>
            <p>That is when things started to get strange.
                One morning my beloved Megan woke up and said:
                "There is somethingI need to tell you. I cannot keep it in me any longer. I don't expect you to
                understand, but you're the only person I can trust."</p>
            <p>At first, I thought she was joking. But she was sweating profusely, and her eyes told me that this wasn't
                some silly prank.</br>
                "What's wrong?" I asked. </br>
                "I get visions and I can see into the future." she said, her lips trembling with each word.</p>
            <p>"Wait. So, like a psychic?" I asked. </p>
            <p>"I don't know. I have always kept it to myself, but it seems I have had this gift since my pregnancy. I
                didn't say anything about this to anyone."</p>
            <p>"But you are an atheist who prides herself in trusting logic and facts over anything else. I thought we
                both were like that. Do you really believe that you can see the future?"
            </p>
            <p>"You don't have to believe me just yet. I didn't believe myself either. I just know that I have this gift
                now. I have these visions about certain people and places, and they come true. They always come true. I
                have tried keeping this to myself, but after what I saw today, I had to let you know. Your aunt is going
                to die tomorrow."</p>
            <p>"WHA.. WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?"</p>
            <p>"Yes. Just go over there now. Don't ask any questions"</p>
            <p>My aunt lived a four hour drive away. I really hoped Megan was wrong, but I didn't want to take the risk.
            </p>
            <p>I went out. To this day, I cannot explain what happened next: but it certainly made me believe that my
                wife was psychic. When I was an hour away from her place, I received a call from my cousin telling me
                that my aunt had slipped and fell down the stairs. She instantly died from the concussion. </p>
            <p>Megan was right. This surely, can’t be a coincidence. </p>
            <p>Over the next few weeks, Megan got visions of little things- like what would I get to see at work, who
                would visit us during the weekend, even what Birthday present did I bring although I have managed to
                keep it hidden from her - and she was right every time.</p>
            <p>We learnt to live with it, slowly unless the visions were tragic like someone close getting fired or
                dying.</p>
            <p>I didn't believe in these things throughout my life- but it was hard being a non believer, when you're
                seeing these things happen with your own eyes in your own life.</p>
            <p>I had asked her why she didn't tell me about her gift earlier, but she said that she had no idea about
                it. It was only when she was pregnant that she started getting these visions. </p>
            <p>I still loved Megan, and I always would. That will never change. If she said that the sky was red: it was
                red. If it wasn't, I'd paint it red. </p>
            <p>Things were alright for a while, and I'd like to believe that this was the time in our lives, that we
                were truly happy. I loved Megan and my little beautiful daughter, Catherine. Megan loved her and spent
                most of her time playing with her. They were both so adorable, it filled my heart with happiness every
                single day.</p>
            <p>We were happy, in love and raising a beautiful child. Her having a psychic gift was a bonus, at that
                point. </p>
            <p>However, not all happy stories end on a happier note. Ours, unfortunately, wasn't an exception.

                Last year, Catherine died because of a heart condition that couldn't be remedied. Megan was devastated
                and so was I. It was the toughest time of our lives, and I knew that I had to be strong for her. I was
                her only shoulder to cry on. But most of the time, I broke down alone in rooms of silence, when I was
                sure she wasn't around. I knew I couldn't ever get over that and Megan couldn't either. She spent her
                nights crying and clutching on to me. She spent her mornings waking up and crying. On most days, I tried
                to calm her down but on the few days when my heart couldn't handle the unbearable pain of our loss, we
                held each other and cried.
            </p>
            <p>Our perfect life was over. Weeks passed by like this. Megan ate less, and stopped going out of the house
                altogether.</p>
            <p>I couldn't bear to see her like that but there was nothing I could do. I was sure that something inside
                Megan shattered, and she wasn't the same person. She didn't speak during the day and she cried at night.
                She looked at Catherine’s crib and broke down crying, every time she looked at it. </p>
            <p>I tried my best to be there for her. I still loved her more than anything else, and seeing her in such
                misery reminded me of the blissful times in our lives, that we both had taken for granted.</p>
            <p>It also seemed that her gift of getting visions went away with the passing of our daughter. She used to
                stare at walls and ceilings hoping for visions, and whenever she got one (or claimed to get one), she
                told me about them but it never came true. Her gift had truly gone, and she had become a soulless,
                depressed version of the woman I had once known. It was perhaps Catherine has something to do with it,
                since she started getting these visions when Catherine came into this world, and lost it with her
                passing. I'm sure she realized this as well, but wasn't ready to accept it.
            </p>
            <p>A few weeks later, she told me that she saw, in a vision, that our neighbour's dog will die. Like all her
                visions since our daughter died, I thought this one was not going to come true as well.
            </p>
            <p>However, things were different on the next morning. For the first time since a long time, I saw Megan
                smile.
            </p>
            <p>"The neighbour's dog. It died!" she said. "My gift is back! Do you understand what this means?"</br>

                "Eh, no Megan." I said, still trying to process everything.</br>

                "It means I can see the future again!" she said and hugged me. </p>
            <p>I held her tightly and hugged her. For the first time since Catherine passed away, she wasn't crying as
                soon as she woke up. Rather, she was happy.
            </p>
            <p>"You don't believe me, do you?" she asked. </p>
            <p>"I do" I said and kissed her. She kissed me back with eyes wide open, and I realized then, that something
                was still wrong with her.
            </p>
            <p>However, I still loved her and I always would. Losing your own daughter and recovering from the shock
                isn't going to be a pleasant experience, but I sincerely hoped she hadn't gone crazy. </p>
            <p>The next few days went by normally. Megan was less upset. Getting her gift back, somehow seemed like a
                silver lining in her life.
            </p>
            <p>She told me that in one of her visions she saw her abusive brother dying within a week. Her brother was
                an abusive leech to both her parents, and it was obvious that Megan wanted him to die.
            </p>
            <p>"Are you sure this is a vision and not just your fantasy ? " I said, expecting her to laugh at the joke.
                </br>
                "No. He'll die. " she said, in a straight voice.
            </p>
            <p>Her brother did die, and the police are still investigating his murder. Someone had apparently stabbed
                him in his throat and left him to die in his car.
            </p>
            <p>When the police came over to our place for questioning, Megan gave me a look I'll never forget. While the
                police weren't looking, she looked at me and smiled from ear to ear.
            </p>
            <p>She never did like her brother, but even after hearing the news about his death: she wasn't affected.
            </p>
            <p>The police went away, but they're still investigating the case. I just hope to God they don't come by
                knocking our door again.
            </p>
            <p>I think Megan is getting happier though. She talks to me more frequently and doesn't cry anymore.
            </p>
            <p>Last week, Megan told me that she saw Mr. Ledger or "Bad mouth Joker" as he was known in the
                neighbourhood would die. Sure enough, he died the next day with a knife stuck in his spine. I saw Megan
                happy again when she got to know. Never did I expect the love of my life to be happy hearing about
                people dying. </p>
            <p>It seemed that, now, she expected this and this was the only thing that mattered to her. The fact that
                these people whom we knew, who lived barely a block away, were brutally murdered: didn't seem to bother
                her.
            </p>
            <p>It might seem weird that most of my wife's predictions about people dying were being fulfilled by them
                being murdered. It's also a weird coincidence that these people were people she wasn't fond of. Rather,
                she strongly disliked them.
            </p>
            <p>So, I know what you might probably be thinking. It's her. She's killing these people to fulfil her
                visions because after Catherine’s death, she has gone crazy.
                But I've always loved my wife. I know that whatever Megan is, she is not a killer and she isn't capable
                of doing this.
            </p>
            <p>I know she's not a killer.
            </p>
            <p>I know she's not.</p>
            <p>Because I am.
            </p>
            <p>Poisoning a dog and stabbing two men in the dark, were easy and I'd do it all over again for her. I'll
                keep fulfilling all her visions, if that's what it takes to see a smile on her beautiful face.
            </p>
            <p>Like I said, I'd do anything for her.
                If she said that you were going to die, you will die.
            </p>
            <p>I'll make sure you do.

            </p>
            <p>If she said that the sky was red: it was red. If it wasn't, I'll paint it red. </p>
            <p>With your blood...</p>
