        <article>
            <p>
                In the depths of the night,
                When the world is still and quiet,</br>
                And the stars above twinkle bright,
                A shiver runs down my spine.</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                For I know that lurking nearby,
                In the shadows just out of sight,</br>
                Are forces of darkness and fright,
                Waiting to pounce and strike.</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Peace out, they say, with a sneer,
                As they plot and plan and conspire,</br>
                To tear apart what we hold dear,
                And set our world ablaze with fire.</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                But we will not be cowed or scared,
                For we know the power of ferocity,</br>
                And we will stand together, prepared,
                To defend our precious commodity.</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                With courage in our hearts and minds,
                And a fierce determination to fight,</br>
                We will push back against these dark designs,
                And keep our world bathed in light.</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                So let them come, these agents of fear,
                With their twisted agendas and hate,</br>
                For we will face them without a tear,
                And send them packing, with no debate.</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                For we are the guardians of peace,
                And we will not rest until we have won,</br>
                Against all those who seek to fleece,
                The very fabric of what we call home.</br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Peace out, we say, with a smile,
                As we celebrate our hard-earned victory,</br>
                And we know that, for a little while,
                Our world will be safe and free.</br>
