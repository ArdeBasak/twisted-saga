            <p>Tom’s boss had received a promotion and threw a party at his house on Friday. Tom was also invited. His
                10 year old daughter, Jennifer also accompanied him.</p>
            <p>After a sumptuous dinner, they planned to leave early since their place was 25 miles away. After crossing
                10 miles, Tom found himself driving down a deserted country road. It was drizzling and the sound of the
                raindrops drumming on the car roof made Jennifer doze off. Tom took a glance at her and the innocence in
                her face brought a smile to his face and made him realize how lucky he was.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, there was a loud bang. Tom struggled with the steering wheel and the car skidded off the wet
                road and slammed into a stone wall.</p>
            <p>After checking that Jennifer wasn’t injured, Tom went outside to examine the car’s damages. Both the
                front tires were mangled and the hood was crumpled against the wall on the left side. The rest of the
                car, though, had survived the crash unscathed.</p>
            <p>Tom speculated that perhaps we had run over something on the road. Whatever it was, it exploded both
                tires, he continued to consider.</p>
            <p>"Papa, are you sure you can repair it?" Jennifer, who was visibly rattled by the incident, enquired.</p>
            <p>“No,” replied Tom, nodding his head in despair. “I have got only one spare in the boot.” Remembering that
                they passed a petrol station just a mile back, he continued, “I’ll have to walk back to the petrol
                station and try to get someone who can help us.”</p>
            <p>“It isn’t that far from here. Since it is raining outside and I don’t want you to fall sick, you wait in
                the car while I’m gone,” exclaimed Tom, trying to regain his composure.</p>
            <p>“Okay,” she said, reluctantly. “But please don’t take too long.”</p>
            <p>Tom could see in her eyes that she was frightened. “Sit tight,” replied Tom as he kissed her forehead. “I
                promise I will be back as soon as possible.”</p>
            <p>Jennifer watched him in the rear-view mirror as he trudged off down the road in the pouring rain and
                disappeared into the night.</p>
            <p>More than an hour passed and Tom still had not returned. She began to wonder what was taking him so long.
                She was very worried because he should have been back by now.</p>
            <p>Just then, she saw a person strolling towards the vehicle in the distance as she quickly turned to look
                in the rearview mirror. She initially assumed it was her father, but when she spun around to get a
                better look, she saw that he appeared strange. He had a large, thick moustache and was wearing overalls.
                He was slinging something heavy in his left hand, back and forth.</p>
            <p>She felt very uneasy around him. She squinted her eyes and looked out the rear window as he got closer.
                She was able to make out what he had in his right palm in spite of the low light. It was a sizable,
                razor-sharp butcher knife.</p>
            <p>Jennifer began sobbing out of fear. However, she swiftly locked the front doors of the vehicle after
                which she sprang into the back seat, locked the back doors, and hid there. She noticed the strange man
                had stopped in his tracks and was attempting to get a glimpse inside the car when she glanced up.</p>
            <p>Jennifer screamed in agony as the man abruptly lifted his left arm. He was holding her father's severed
                cranium in his left hand. She simply continued screaming incessantly. She was powerless to resist. Her
                heart started pounding, her pulse racing. It was horrifying to see her father's grotesque look. His eyes
                were rolled back in his skull, and his mouth was hanging open.</p>
            <p>The man then thrusted his face against the glass and stared at her with bloodshot, crazed eyes. His
                untamed, dirt-matted hair was unruly. Deep wounds were visible all over his face.</p>
            <p>He stared at her like a madman for a minute, then reached into his pocket, pulled something out, and
                slowly raised his bloodstained left hand, holding her father's silver car keys.</p>
