        <article>
            <p>It was a usual Friday evening. The city was readying up for the weekend. I left my office around 6pm. I
                was pretty tired after a hard day. I tried to book an Uber but I was unable to connect to my mobile
                data. So, after pondering for a while on whether to take the bus or not, I saw a yellow taxi approaching
                me.</p>
            <p>The taxi stopped before me. "To where, sir?" said a deep voice as he rolled down his window.</p>
            <p>“Borewell Road?" I asked.</p>
            <p>"Sure. Get in".</p>
            <p>He seemed to be in his forties with a grey beard that made him look older. I got inside and within a
                while of slow moving traffic, we reached NH48. We went up on the highway and plugging my earphones, I
                kept staring outside at the evening sky.</p>
            <p>The road was more or less empty. It was eerily too desolate, without a single car passing us by or even
                in front of us. We crossed a gas station, a service centre and then a temple. Then we crossed a big
                billboard. After that, we were supposed to take a left turn.</p>
            <p>I didn’t pay much heed to the road as I was quite busy marvelling at the twilight. Most of the days, I
                would either doze off or spend my time fidgeting with my phone. </p>
            <p>“But that is when things started to get absurd. There was no left turn. The empty road just kept moving
                forward endlessly. This didn't bother me at first. I chucked it up to me being inattentive every other
                day, as I never did look at the road. Maybe the left turn was a bit further down the road, I thought.
            </p>
            <p>The evening sun was still, with the orange sky surrounding the landscape.</p>
            <p>That's when it happened. Our taxi crossed the gas station, the service centre and the temple again. Till
                this day, I never had a feeling of deja vu as strong as the one I had that day. </p>
            <p>Then came the billboard. Then there was supposed to be a left turn. But the road just kept moving
                endlessly forward. </p>
            <p>I thought I had quite a hard day at office and my weary mind was playing tricks on me. I considered
                taking a nap but couldn’t shut my eyes after seeing what happened.</p>
            <p>I was vigilant now. But then, it happened again. The car crossed the gas station, the service centre and
                the temple again. </p>
            <p>The setting sun was fixated at the same position, or at least it looked like that to me. </p>
            <p>I slowly started freaking out. The taxi driver seemed unnerved by all this. It's as if he didn't even
                notice. </p>
            <p>Then came the billboard, again. Just like the last time, there was no left turn. The car kept going
                endlessly straight on the empty highway. We crossed the gas station, the service centre and the temple
                again. </p>
            <p>Then the billboard passed by. And again as I had unfortunately expected, there was no left turn. </p>
            <p>I was terrified at what was happening at this point. I looked at the driver, and he didn't seem to care.
                By the fourth time this was starting to happen, I knew I had to get off.</p>
            <p>A wide array of thoughts were racing past my mind and my immediate response was to get off the taxi. </p>
            <p>I knew the driver could sense my nervousness after the fourth time. I did not know what was happening and
                I had never felt so helpless in life before. </p>
            <p>"Can you drop me off near the gas station?" I said, trying to maintain my calm as best as I could. </p>
            <p>He didn't respond. With a straight face, he kept driving. </p>
            <p>What the hell is happening?
                "Excuse me. I want to get off at the gas station" I said.
                "We can't do that. We have to keep going" he said calmly with a voice that managed to echo inside the
                small taxi.</p>
            <p>I was so afraid that I didn't have the courage to ask why. Beads of sweat were beginning to form on my
                forehead even on a cool winter evening.</p>
            <p>I gripped a pen from my bag and sat holding it. If he tries to make any sudden move, I'm going for his
                throat, I thought.</p>
            <p>I didn't know what to do. The doors were unlocked but the car was moving at a speed which would guarantee
                a lot of fractured bones if I decided to jump out.</p>
            <p>I decided to wait. The sun stood still, and the orange sky in all its magnificent glory suddenly looked
                terrifying as if it is bleeding. I had this feeling that it might well be my last day.</p>
            <p>The gas station passed by, along with the service centre and the temple. Then the billboard passed by and
                the car kept going forward.</p>
            <p>Then again it happened. And again. </p>
            <p>I started feeling nauseous at this point. My stomach turned and I felt like the ride would go on forever.
                What am I supposed to do, anyway? </p>
            <p>I felt like crying. I was afraid of asking the driver anything after his last response. I didn't want to
                lose my mind, even though I could feel the adrenaline surging in my body urging me to do something.</p>
            <p>The gas station passed by again, as did the service centre and the temple. Then the billboard. Then, when
                I was least expecting, finally a left turn appeared in front of us. The taxi turned left and I felt a
                wave of relief wash over me. I was finally going home. </p>
            <p>What just happened, I thought? Why did I see the same road, over and over again? Was I stuck in a time
                loop? Was I in a parallel dimension? Will it happen again right now?</p>
            <p>Even though I was an atheist, I was praying to reach home safely and trying not to think so much. I was
                sure I would jump out of the taxi if I saw another road repeating.</p>
            <p>But none of that happened. We reached my home after a journey, which felt like forever. As soon as it
                stopped, I got off the taxi as hurriedly as possible.</p>
            <p>I regained my composure and asked “How much?".</p>
            <p>I was too afraid of asking him anything else about our ride but looking at his face, I knew that he knew
                what had happened and why. But, I was too afraid of finding out what. I just wanted to go home and
                return back to my normal life. He just kept looking at me, and then I saw his eyes. They were filling up
                with tears. That was the last thing I saw before he abruptly looked forward and drove away without
                taking any fare.</p>
            <p>That was it. The weirdest and most terrifying experience of my life. </p>
            <p>I thought the worst was over, till I went home and switched on the TV.
                In the evening news, one headline was such that sent a chill down my spine.</p>
            <p>"Major accident alert: </br>
                A truck swerved into a yellow taxi at 3 pm on NH48, killing the taxi driver instantly. 3 others suffered
                minor injuries. According to sources, the taxi driver was a man in his forties. Police are currently
                investigating and rescue personnel are still on spot.</p>
            <p>Highway shall remain closed till tomorrow. "</p>
